            <h3 class="hazard">Concerns about dangerous candies!</h3>
            <p> class="hazard">One of the biggest concerns for parents
                around trick-or treating is a fear of the candy being tampered with or sabotaged
                as to cause harm to kids.  These cases are very uncommon however it is always important
                to use common sense if you feel that the candy you have is sketchy or came from an unreliable
                source.
            </p>
            <h3>Many more to choose!</h3>
            <p>
                The candies listed here are just a few of the ones
                you will discover in the wild.  As you trick-or-treat,
                you are likely to find different candies not on this list,
                some you may never have heard of but really like.  Some might
                be more generic and others a popular brand.  However, always
                remember that these treats have different appeal, because some
                may like or dislike your favorite treats more than others.  It
                is all based on your taste so just find what you enjoy and have

                You wouldn't realize it, but there are a number of things
                and events that are held to celebrate Halloween pretty much
                everywhere you can think of.  While mentioned trick-or-treating
                previously, this list will encompass not just trick-or treating but
                also other events you may not have been aware of.

                <li><h4 class="events">Trick-or-treating</h4>
                    <p>
                        Trick-or-treating is probably the most widely-known way to celebrate
                        Halloween.  It can be done at any time of day on Halloween, but
                        if you wish to enhance your experience, you can do it when it is darker
                        to make it extra creepy.  You can go around from house to house, knocking
                        on the doors and saying "trick or treat!"  This will promptly reward you
                        with some candy if you have a costume on.  The goal is simply to get as much
                        the process to get more candy and have more fun, you should consider trick-or-treating
                        with a group of friends.

                <li><h4 class="events">Haunted houses and attractions</h4>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, in either public areas or in ammusement parks, you can find attractions
                        and haunted houses that may require fees for admission but overall can provide great
                        fun.  Once again, similar to trick-or-treating, many of these events are better experienced
                        at night and or with friends because of the nature of Halloween.  In either case, haunted houses
                        typically consist of tight corridors, random jumpscares, and creepy images or sounds that
                        is intented to rattle you with fear.  This applies to other attractions as well, however none of
                        them will be for the faint of heart.  You should go in, if you dare!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><h4 class="events">Game Events</h4>
                    <p>
                        For those either stuck at home or suffer from being shy and anti-social, you also have a way of
                        celebrating Halloween that doesn't require any type of physical or social interaction.  At this
                        time of year, for almost the whole month in some cases, many popular games will feature a Halloween
                        themed event that can make the mood feel right for the time of year.  These events will typically
                        add new things to the game, such as halloween-related rewards, quests, monsters, pets, mounts, etc.
                        Halloween events don't happen in every game, however when they do and you have a group of friends that
                        want to play too, you can have just a good of a time playing your game as actually going outside.

                <li><h4 class="events">Halloween parties</h4>
                    <p id="lastp">
                        Sometimes, people like to celebrate Halloween by throwing a halloween themed party and having fun with
                        loved ones and friends.  These parties often times feature music, people in costume, cupcakes, snacks,
                        and if the party is <b>really</b> cool, a smoke machine.  This doesn't just pertain to individuals either,
                        as sometimes there are some public places such as schools and certain stores that like to hold their own
                        parties and invite people to them.

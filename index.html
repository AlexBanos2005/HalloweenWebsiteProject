            <h3>Welcome to the website!</h3>
            <p>Halloween is one of the greatest times of year for its amazing
                creepy vibes and chance to get tons of candy.  If you celebrate
                Halloween like me, you already know how fun it can be when you
                spend it with friends.  However, this website is for those that
                either don't celebrate the holiday or just don't like it much.
                View the different parts of this page and then tell me what you
                think about the holiday then.  For now, if you want, I have different
                Halloween themed videos you can watch if you get bored.

            <h3>Thriller</h3>
            <p>
                Whenever anybody thinks of music and Halloween at the same time, the
                song that normally everyone thinks about is Thriller by Michael Jackoson.
                Even though the song released in 2009, today it is still seen in ads like
                Party City and shown throughout schools and parties or events.  Thats why
                even 11 years after it's original release, new generations still know and
                also remember Thriller, arguably making it the most popular Halloween song
                to date.

            <h3>Halloween Pranks</h3>
            <p>
                Prank at your own risk!  Halloween is a time to enjoy some good laughs and
                candy.  That doesn't mean you can't be mischevious from time to time.  If you
                want to prank some of your friends, the video included above should give you plenty
                of ways of going about it.
            </p>
            <h3>DIY Costumes</h3>
            <p>
                While I didn't include a video for this, you must know that you don't always have to
                break the bank everytime you want to wear a halloween costume.  If you got some time,
                paitence, and some decent arts and craft skills, you can make a great halloween costume
                with materials that are likely already around your home.  Good channels for stuff like this
                would include Threadbanger.  However, if youtube isn't your thing, you are bound to find a
                number of posts on many different websites that can help you with your costume ideas.

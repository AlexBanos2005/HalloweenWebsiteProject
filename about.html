            <h3 id="whatishalloween">What is Halloween?</h3>
            <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween">Wikipedia</a>, Halloween is...<br>
                "<i>Halloween or Hallowe'en (a contraction of Hallows' Even or Hallows' Evening), also known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve, or All Saints' Eve, is a celebration observed in many countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed.
                It is widely believed that many Halloween traditions originated from ancient Celtic harvest festivals, particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain; that such festivals may have had pagan roots; and that Samhain itself was Christianized as Halloween by the early Church.  Some believe, however, that Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, separate from ancient festivals like Samhain.</i>"

            <h3 id="Whattododuringhalloween">What do you do during Halloween?</h3>
            <p>
                Halloween is a time where you dress up in costume and perform the act of trick or treating.  For those that do not know what trick or treating is, it is when you dress up in a costume and knock on different houses and stores to say trick or treat.  When you say trick or treat, the person should be obligated to give you as much candy as they see fit.  The main goal is to rack up as much candy as possible in order to have a stack of candy by the time you
                finish you're trick or treating.  While I have now mentioned the idea of candies and costumes being an important role for halloween, I have also madee a dedicated page on this website for each of those topics.  Just so you are aware though, this isn't the only way to celebrate Halloween.  It is also perfectly acceptable to sit at home and hand candy out for the people that <b>do</b> trick or treat.  This is simply the most popular
                way that people like to celebrate Halloween.
            </p>
            <h3 id="SpecificAge">Is there a specific age or ages to celebrate Halloween?</h3>
            <p>Depends on the type of person you are.  While you rarely see any grown adults trick or treating, there is technically no age at which you are unable to perform any tasks that take place during Halloween.</p>
